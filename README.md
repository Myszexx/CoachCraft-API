# CoachCraft

CoachCraft is a coach support tool based on a player rating system, designed to help create optimal team lineups based on match and training results. The project allows for evaluating player form over time and generating suggested lineups, taking into account factors such as form, position, and player availability.

## Features

- **Player Rating System**: Track player performance based on match events (goals, assists, cards) and training ratings.
- **Automatic Lineup Generation**: Create team lineups based on player ratings, preferred positions, and availability (injuries, suspensions).
- **Machine Learning Integration (optional)**: Predict player form and suggest optimal lineups using machine learning algorithms.
- **Backend API**: API for managing player data, matches, and training sessions.
- **Frontend Application**: User interface to view player statistics, match results, and generate lineups.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize player performance over time using interactive charts.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Python (Django)
- **Database**: Oracle (or MariaDB for prototyping)
- **Machine Learning**: TBD (optional)
- **Server**: Hosted on TrueNAS with Docker
